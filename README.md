# Character-Input

This is a practice problem.

#The Problem

In this program, I will ask the user to input their name and age.  Once the user has made the appropriate inputs, the program will then tell the user what year they will turn 100 years old.

#Extras

1)  Ask the user for another number, then print the message that many times.

2) Print out the message the number of times the user inputs, but on separate lines.
